# Rebelix
Some modified source files for my Rebelix X2. You need the original code from the [RebeliX original repository](https://github.com/RepRap4U/RebeliX "Original repository").

 * **RAMPS_cover_40mm_fan.scad** - Modified RAMPS holder cover to take 40mm fan for extra cooling of the board, drivers and mosfets.
 * **spool-center-fillamentum.scad** - Spool center modified to take most available filaments in the Czech Republic. The original design takes "plasty Mladec" and "MK Floria". I added Fillamentum which fits "Rebel By Fillamentum" OEM brand too.
